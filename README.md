# OSMBuilding styling

## Overview

This is a portable HTTPS version of the OSMBuildings styling example from
[the CodePen](https://codepen.io/osmbuildings/pen/aOayQj). That example won't
"just work" because it mixes HTTP/HTTPS content, and can be clunkier to work
with if you want to build from there.

All credit due to [OSMBuildings](http://osmbuildings.org/examples/).

## Use

1. `npm install -g http-server`
2. `http-server ./`
3. Open http://localhost:8080/ in browser.
